## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

Hey there! I'm **Shank** — a passionate developer who enjoys building practical projects with **React** and exploring frontend development in general. This project is a small but functional comment system inspired by social media interactions 🗨️⚡.

I focused on making sure the core logic works well rather than perfecting the design or making it mobile-friendly.

> 🔥 Built with 💻 React + Tailwind CSS  
> 💡 Focused on functionality, not responsiveness  
> 🧑‍💻 Just a solo dev experimenting and learning
